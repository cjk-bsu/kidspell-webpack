# Kidspell Chrome Extension
## An application to help kids with spelling! Developed by the CAST team at Boise State University.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
### 1. Clone this project into a local directory from its main repository.

### 2. In the terminal, use the `$ npm init` command in the the main  project directory to initiate npm package management with the following specifications:
- package name: default
- version number: default or as appropriate
- git repository: leave blank
- keywords: leave blank
- license: default (MIT) or as appropriate

    #### Type `yes` to complete initialization.

### 3. Also in the main project directory, install necessary module and package dependencies with all but react and react-dom as dev dependencies.
- #### Packages
    - react
    - react-dom
    - webpack
    - webpack-cli
    - html-webpack-plugin
    - copy-webpack-plugin
    - webpack-merge
    - @babel/core
    - babel-loader
    - @babel/preset-env
    - @babel/preset-react
    - style-loader
    - css-loader
    - file-loader

    #### The following terminal commands can be utilized to install the above dependendies:

    To install react:
    
        $ npm install react react-dom

    <br />

    To install webpack:

        $ npm install webpack webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin copy-webpack-plugin webpack-merge --save-dev

    <br />

    To install babel:

        $ npm install @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev`

    <br />

    To install additional necessary dependencies:

        $ npm install style-loader css-loader file-loader --save-dev

    <br />


## Generating a Distribution File

### To create a distribution file that can be uploaded for testing or published for download, the following command must be run from the main directory of the project:

    $ npm run build

### This command will generate a usable `dist` directory within the primary home project directory that can then be uploaded and distributed.

### This command will need to be re-run after any alterations or edits are made to the source code and the `dist` directory will have to be reuploaded to reflect those changes in a web browser. Re-running the build command will completely overwrite the previously generated destination `dist` folder. The previous version of the directory will be lost but can be regenerated by reverting back to the code state as it was when it was generated.

### <ins>**IMPORTANT:**</ins> Because Webpack is used to export all packages and source code files once they are compiled as vanilla JS files, all package, file, variable, class, and path references must match the post-export, output `dist` directory schema. That is to say, for example, despite the relative file paths between `manifest.json` and `/src` files in the project directory, the path references must be written in the code, pre-export, to reflect their location post-export in the final `dist` directory. As stated, this includes all inter-file references, export settings in the Webpack config files, etc.
